		<h3 class="text">
					Intramurals is one of the best ways Triangle stays active.
					The brothers compete weekly in numerous events from soccer, and flag football, all the way to table tennis and inner tube water polo.
					Annually our chapter finishes in the top ten in the fraternity league. Triangle holds sportsmanship in high regard.
					Our most competitive events are Track and Field and Ultimate Frisbee.
					During good weather, the brothers hold practices and pick up games to prepare for the seasons and to come together as brothers.
					No matter what your skill level, participation and enthusiasm are priority over competitive and aggressive play.
					The brothers of Triangle cherish their intramurals, and enjoy competing and having fun as a chapter

			<h1 class="text-center word-format2">UKLA</h1>
			<h3 class="text">Leadership and the ability to work well in a team are essential parts of any engineering job.
				University of Kentucky Leadership Advantage (UKLA) is a weekend long program in August for freshman engineering students to learn and practice leadership and team working skills.
				The camp is hosted by brothers of Triangle Fraternity and the College of Engineering.
				The goal of UKLA is to get top incoming freshman off and running before they get to campus, and to emerge as leaders within their class.
				Staying ahead of the game and becoming a leader is key for both the extent of enjoyment in college, and growth as an engineer.
				Communication and social skills are just as important as engineering knowledge. UKLA gives a head start on developing leadership skills for which every company is searching.
